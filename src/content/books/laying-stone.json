    "description": "I was very happy when Richard Soos suggested that Cholla Needles would publish an art book of my poetry and paintings. He wanted 20 poems and 20 paintings, so I immediately began a personal marathon of creativity. I submitted the raw material to him, and he did the rest, even choosing the title and the painting for the cover. He did so much work with the project that it soon became our book. Having an editor/publisher who was intimately involved in producing the final product was one of the best experiences of my professional life. If the book is beautiful, it is due to his genius. I know you will agree when you see it.",
