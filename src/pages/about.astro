            <p>
              Many times I have been encouraged to choose one particular avenue of creativity and concentrate my efforts there. The thinking behind that is mastery requires singular focus.
            </p>
            <p>
              That didn't work for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am not torn between writing, composing, and painting. I find that I need several outlets. I have written a lot of songs and love performing them. The guitar was so much fun, I decided to try my hand at the piano and love it. If I get bored with writing, I play the piano or write a song.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thought painting was a terrible idea since I had tried oil painting at one time and it was a disaster. I had created a canvas of oil mud. But exploring acrylics opened a new world of color and expression for me.
